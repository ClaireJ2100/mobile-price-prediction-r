# New Phone in Market: Predicting Mobile Phone Price Ranges with R

## Introduction
With the rapid rise in mobile phone usage over the past two decades, it’s no surprise that the number of users was projected to reach 7.33 billion by 2023 (Marko, 2021). Alongside this growth, mobile phone prices have also soared. This raises important questions for both consumers and manufacturers: How can we estimate the price range of a mobile phone? What key factors should new phone companies consider when setting their product prices?

In this project, we explore a dataset containing various technical specifications of mobile phones — such as RAM, battery power, screen dimensions, and camera pixel count — and their corresponding price ranges (on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 being the lowest price and 3 the highest).

Using R, we perform data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to investigate whether we can accurately predict the price range of a phone based on its features. Our goal is to uncover insights that can guide pricing strategies in a highly competitive and evolving market.

## About  
This project was completed as part of **data science 100** and explores how mobile phone specifications relate to pricing. Using R, we analyze a dataset of phone features — such as RAM, battery power, and camera quality — to predict the price range of a phone (0 = low, 3 = high). The project involves data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to inform pricing strategies in a competitive tech market.
